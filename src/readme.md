Here’s the **folder structure** with a short description of each file and use:
(See details in the **Notebooks** folder)

```

**Summary:**
This `src` folder is a collection of **refactored scripts** from multiple Jupyter notebooks — each script is self-contained, class/function based and designed to run locally without Colab/Jupyter. They cover **text summarization**, **sequence models**, **sentiment analysis**, **keyword extraction**, and **data analysis/visualization**.
